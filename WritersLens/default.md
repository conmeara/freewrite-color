Welcome to Writers Lens.

This app helps you write better by highlighting patterns in your writing. Each lens reveals something different about your text.

Try cycling through the lenses using the sidebar on the left. Each lens analyzes your writing in real-time, highlighting different patterns and structures.

The Parts of Speech lens colors your words by type: nouns appear in blue, verbs glow in green, adjectives shine in purple, and adverbs are marked in orange. Pronouns are highlighted in magenta. This lens helps you see the grammatical structure of your writing.

The Adverb lens specifically targets adverbs and words ending in -ly. These words can often be eliminated to create stronger, more concise prose. Words like "really", "very", and "quickly" are frequently overused.

Watch for passive voice! The passive voice lens identifies constructions where the subject is acted upon rather than acting. For example, "The ball was thrown by me" is passive, while "I threw the ball" is active. Passive constructions are highlighted so you can rewrite them more directly.

Filler words clutter your writing unnecessarily. The filler lens catches words like "very", "really", "just", "actually", "basically", "literally", "pretty", and "quite" - words that add little meaning. Something was very really quite interesting. That thing was just basically stuff.

Sentence length matters. Short sentences punch hard. Medium-length sentences provide balanced rhythm and give readers time to process your ideas without overwhelming them. Long sentences, however, can become unwieldy and difficult to follow, especially when they contain multiple clauses or complex ideas that might be better expressed through multiple simpler statements that give readers room to breathe.

The repetition lens highlights words you use repeatedly. Repetition can create emphasis, but too much repetition weakens your message. Good repetition serves a purpose. Bad repetition happens accidentally. Notice how "repetition" appears multiple times in these sentences - the repetition lens would color each instance.

Writers Lens gives you instant feedback. Real-time analysis. Immediate insights into your writing patterns.

Start writing and watch the lenses reveal patterns you never noticed before.
