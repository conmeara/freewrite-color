Welcome to Writers Lens.

This app reveals patterns in your writing through real-time analysis. Try cycling through each lens using the sidebar to see different aspects of your text.

Parts of Speech colors your words by grammatical role. Nouns appear in blue, verbs glow in orange, and adjectives shine in yellow. Watch how this sentence transforms: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. Every noun, verb, and adjective becomes visible through color.

Adverb Overuse highlights words ending in -ly and other adverbs. She quickly ran extremely fast, moving incredibly swiftly through the surprisingly empty street. He spoke softly and carefully, barely whispering quietly while nervously glancing around anxiously. These words often weaken your writing unnecessarily.

Passive Voice identifies constructions where subjects are acted upon. The ball was thrown by the pitcher. The letter was written by my friend. The cake was eaten by the children. Mistakes were made by the committee. These sentences lack the directness of active voice: The pitcher threw the ball. My friend wrote the letter.

Word Repetition highlights words you use repeatedly. Good writing requires variety. Variety keeps readers engaged. Without variety, text becomes monotonous. Notice how "variety" appears multiple times. The repetition of "variety" makes this example repetitive. Each instance of repetition signals an opportunity to vary your vocabulary and strengthen your prose through diverse word choices.

Rhythm analyzes sentence length patterns using color temperature. Cool blues and greens indicate varied, rhythmic writing. Warm reds and oranges signal monotonous patterns. Write five short sentences. Then write five more. Keep going like this. See the pattern emerge. Notice how it feels. Mixing sentence lengths creates natural rhythm that carries readers through your text, alternating between punchy statements and more elaborate explorations of ideas, building momentum through variation rather than through mechanical repetition of similar structures.

Filler Words catches words that clutter your writing. This is very really quite interesting, actually. That thing was just basically stuff, literally. It's pretty much essentially a kind of situation where something was sort of happening, you know. The presentation was absolutely totally completely amazing, apparently. Perhaps it's merely somewhat fairly good, possibly.

Sentence Length reveals rhythm through color. Short punches hard. Medium-length sentences provide balanced rhythm and give readers breathing room. Long sentences can become difficult to follow, especially when they contain multiple subordinate clauses, complex ideas, and elaborate descriptions that might be better expressed through multiple simpler statements that allow readers to process information without becoming overwhelmed by syntactic complexity.

Show vs. Tell (AI-powered) finds statements that tell emotions instead of showing them. Sarah was nervous before the interview. The house looked messy and chaotic. The sunset was beautiful and peaceful. Compare these to showing: Sarah's hands trembled as she checked her resume for the third time. Dishes overflowed from the sink onto counters buried under unopened mail. Golden light painted the clouds while waves whispered against the shore.
